Hi! I am Mengqi Zhang (张孟奇), a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/), and a member of the [Information Retrieval Lab](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/index_en.htm). Prior to this position, I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), under the supervision of Prof. [Liang Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8kzzUboAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and co-advised by Prof. [Shu Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=qVge6YYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Qiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=D-lKLcMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research primarily focuses on the **trustworthiness and controllability of large language models (LLMs)**, with particular interests in **knowledge updating, interpretability, and model safety**, including tasks such as **knowledge editing, machine unlearning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. Previously, I have also conducted extensive research in temporal knowledge graph reasoning and recommender systems. 

**招生信息 (Recruitment):** I am always looking for self-motivated students to work on LLMs. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in pursuing a Master's degree, a Ph.D., an undergraduate research assistant position, or exploring potential collaborations. 
**欢迎对大模型研究感兴趣的同学（保研、考研或本科生科研助理）通过邮件与我联系，也欢迎任何形式的学术探讨与合作！** Email: [mengqi.zhang [at] sdu [dot] edu [dot] cn](mailto:mengqi.zhang@sdu.edu.cn)
