Hi! I am Mengqi Zhang (张孟奇), a tenure-track assistant professor in the [School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/),
and also a member of the [Information Retrieval Lab](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/index_en.htm). Prior to this position, I earned my 
Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), under the supervision of Professor 
[Liang Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8kzzUboAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and co-advised by 
Professors [Shu Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=qVge6YYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and 
[Qiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=D-lKLcMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

我的研究兴趣主要聚焦于大语言模型的可信性与可控性，包括知识更新、可解释性分析与模型安全性等关键问题，涉及任务如知识编辑、遗忘学习以及检索增强生成等。
此外，我也曾在动态知识图谱推理与推荐系统方向开展过相关研究。**有兴趣保研、考研或本科生科研助理的，欢迎联系。** My research primarily focuses on the **trustworthiness and controllability of large language models (LLMs)**, 
with particular interests in **knowledge updating, interpretability, and model safety**, including tasks such as **knowledge editing, unlearning, and retrieval-augmented generation**. 
I have also conducted research in temporal knowledge graph reasoning and recommender system. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about my work 
or exploring potential collaborations ([mengqi.zhang [at] sdu [dot] edu [dot] cn](mailto:mengqi.zhang@sdu.edu.cn)).
