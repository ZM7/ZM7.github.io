Hi! I am Mengqi Zhang (张孟奇), a tenure-track assistant professor in the [School of Computer Science and Technology of Shandong University](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/),
and a member of the [Information Retrieval Lab](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/index_en.htm). Before that, I got my Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Automation, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), under the supervision of Professor 
[Liang Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=8kzzUboAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and co-advised by 
Associate Professors [Shu Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=qVge6YYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and 
[Qiang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=D-lKLcMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interests focus on **Complex Dynamic Graph Learning, Large Language Model (Model Edit), Recommender Systems, 
and Temporal Knowledge Graphs**. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about my work 
or exploring potential collaborations ([mengqi.zhang [at] sdu [dot] edu [dot] cn](mailto:mengqi.zhang@sdu.edu.cn)).
